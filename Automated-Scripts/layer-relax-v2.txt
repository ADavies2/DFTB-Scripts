# Test for XYZ scanning

## SOP FOR NEW COFS

1. Optimize monolayer of COF
2. Replicate to two layers of COF
    a. Scan XYZ stacking and offset to determine PES
        I. When scanning in Z, the simulation cell in Z is changed to a set length and the cell is replicated
        Lengths that will be tested are 2, 3, 4, and 6 angstroms above the MAX Z coordinate
        II. When scanning in X, the simulation cell is replicated and the atom positions of the second layer are shifted by a percent of the simulation cell
        III. When scanning in Y, perform same as in X but with Y simulation cell
        NOTE: Scanning will be done in increments of 20%
        QUESTION: Does 50% in X == 50% in Y?
    b. Optimize at this position
3. Calculate stacking energy, enthalpy of formation, and cohesive energy
    a. Enthalpy of formation for two layers in unit cell
    b. Cohesive energy for two layers in unit cell
    c. Single-point calculation for stacking (interaction) energy
        I. Remove layer A, single point energy (= energy layer B)
        II. Remove layer B, single point energy (= energy layer A)
        III. E(int) = E(AB)-E(A)-E(B)

## PSEUDO CODE

1. Input.vasp with AA stacked COF
    a. Read Input.vasp and set-up dftb_in.hsd for single-point calculation at z = 6 Ang
    b. Run single-point DFTB calculation
    c. Copy Total Energy to .dat file (X Y Z Energy)
    d. Repeat single point for z = 5, 4, and 3 Ang

2. Change zy by 10% simulation cell (x = AA or 0%)
    a. Run single-point DFTB calculation at z = 6 Ang
    b. Copy Total Energy to .dat file
    c. Repeat for z = 5, 4 and 3 Ang

3. Continue repeating for zy = 0% - 50%
