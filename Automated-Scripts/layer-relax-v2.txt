# Test for XYZ scanning

## PSEUDO CODE

1. Input.vasp with AA stacked COF
    a. Read Input.vasp and set-up dftb_in.hsd for single-point calculation at z = 6 Ang
    b. Run single-point DFTB calculation
    c. Copy Total Energy to .dat file (X Y Z Energy)
    d. Repeat single point for z = 5, 4, and 3 Ang

2. Change zy by 10% simulation cell (x = AA or 0%)
    a. Run single-point DFTB calculation at z = 6 Ang
    b. Copy Total Energy to .dat file
    c. Repeat for z = 5, 4 and 3 Ang

3. Continue repeating for zy = 0% - 50%
