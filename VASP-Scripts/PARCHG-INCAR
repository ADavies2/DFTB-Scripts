# This is an example VASP INCAR for a partial charge density calculation at specific energy levels. 
# This would be used, for instance, when calculating the charge density at the band edges. This can be specified
# the tag, IBAND, and give the HOMO LUMO equivalent band levels. Or any levels that you desire to see a partial
# charge density for. LSEPB specifies separate partial charge files.
