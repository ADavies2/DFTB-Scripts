# This is an example VASP script for a non-self-consistent field calculation
# The purpose of this calculation is to take an already optimized geometry and calculate the electronic distribution, possibly at a different k-point mesh. This is done prior to a band structure, DOS, or partial charge calculation. This is why LWAVE = .TRUE. to run a PARCHG calculation.
