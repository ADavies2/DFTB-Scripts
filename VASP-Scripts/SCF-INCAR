# The following is an example VASP script for a self-consistent field geometry optimization
# ISIF is currently set to 4, which is only optimizing the forces and the length of the cell vectors, but not the volume of the cell. This is for a monolayer calculation. For stacked calculations, change ISIF to 3.
