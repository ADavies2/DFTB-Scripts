This standard operating procedure details the steps for generating a system consisting of a COF monolayer, water, and 0.5 M NaCl using the software packages, PACKMOL and DFTB+.

1. Optimize a monolayer of the COF of interest using DFTB+. Use the optimization thresholds 1e-5 for SCC and 1e-4 for forces. 
  a. It is likely that the unit cell you previously optimized is triclinic. PACKMOL does not currently work with triclinic cells.
  b. In order to solvate this COF monolayer using PACKMOL, you must convert the triclinc unit cell into a rectangular unit cell.
2. Within OVITO, replicate your optimized monolayer unit cell 2Ã—2. 
  a. Manually select the atoms that would fall within a rectangular/square unit cell from this supercell. 
  b. Invert this selection and delete all other atoms. 
  c. Apply an AffineTransformation to the simulation cell only. Change the simulation cell parameters to be 0 in any off-diagonal indices. 
  d. Change the diagonal values of the simulation cell such that the replicated square cell results in a continuous COF. 
3. Export this structure as a .vasp file from OVITO. 
4. Optimize your rectangular/square unit cell with DFTB+. 
  a. Turn LatticeOpt = Yes
  b. FixAngles = Yes
  c. Use the optimization thresholds of 1e-5 for SCC and 1e-4 for forces. 
5. Your resultant optimized rectangular/square unit cell should lay almost identically over your original triclinic unit cell.
