This file is an standard operating procedure for the coordinate driving method to get the single-molecule barrier energy of water through a stacked COF procedure

1. Use the Place-H2O.py script to place the H2O molecule at the top of the pore of the COF, or in the middle of the pore, depending on the number of layers included in your file. The file water.vasp is a relaxed H2O molecule. 
This file is required by Place-H2O.py.
