This text file is a standard operating procedure for producing COF unit cells, beginning with ChemDraw. 

1. Draw the full pore COF structure in ChemDraw.
  a. Be sure to include each hydrogen explicitly. Charge balance carbon and nitrogen atoms, in particular. 
  b. Use the "3D Structure Clean-Up" feature when complete. 
2. Export the drawn structure as a .mol file. 
3. Read this .mol file into VESTA in order to convert into a .vasp file format. 
4. Read this .vasp file into OVITO.
  a. Determine the unit cell. Be sure to delete any overlapping atoms. 
5. Export this unit cell structure as a .vasp file format and optimize with DFTB+.
